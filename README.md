# Flask-RestfullAPI

Iâ€™m going to create a simple REST API with Flask and FlaskRESTful, step by step.

Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.
